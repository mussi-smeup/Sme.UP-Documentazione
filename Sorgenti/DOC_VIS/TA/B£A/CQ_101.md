# ERP DB Interfaces
Interfaces ensuring the integration between the Q9000 module and the company ERP. The integration and the relationship between the different datasets are defined during the implementation phase of the solution. The interface accesses the data in real time without any redundant archives.


- Master data :  an interface integrating the ERP master data.
-- Customers/Vendors
-- Materials
-- Locations
-- Employees
-- Cost Centers
-- Work Centers
-- ...


- Technical data :  an interface integrating  BOMs, routings and company costs
-- BOMs
-- Routings
-- Costs
-- ...


- Handlings :  an interface integrating the Q9000 subsystems (modules) to different handlings
-- Purchasing Goods receipts
-- Subcontract work goods receipts
-- Customer Returns
-- Goods Receipt from production orders
-- ...

Any goods receipt can generate a data in Q9000 (e.g. lot numbers from purchasing goods receipts) and, conversely, any Q9000 event can generate data in the ERP system (e.g. conforming lots triggering automated data handlings). The complexity of the interfaces has a dependency on the company requirements for automated handlings.

# Operating Modules
Modules supporting processing and management activities

- Tools Management : 
-- allows the classification/ranking and the serial number definition of the measuring tools;
-- supports the calibration operations and it manages any relevant documentation;
-- allows the definition of the traceability chain of the controls (SIT samples, primary tools, secondary tools)

- Sampling Plan Management : 
-- features the use of statistical methods in compliance with the norms UNI 4842/75 and MILITARY STANDARD 105D  (preinstalled);
-- allows the definition of customized sampling plans.

- Test Routings Management : 
-- allows the definition of the tools and sampling methods to be selected for each item and for each routing phase/item during the control and testing operations.

- Test Routings Management : 
-- allows the definition of the tools and sampling methods to be selected for each item and for each routing phase/item during the control and testing operations.

- Lots and control claims management : 
-- defines the internal batch number assignment for assigned goods receipt
-- features the control activities integrated in the set-up of the tools and of the test routings
-- supports the definition of the control results and the recording of the NCs

- Control and test sample management : 
-- allows the recording of the sample measurements (by variables/attributes)

- NC Management : 
-- handles any NC detected in the Lots management activities
-- defines and manages response actions, costs and credit/debit documents



# Analysis Module
This module provides analysis reports of events triggered in the Operating Module


- Pareto Analysis
-- ABC analysis on Lots and NCs (e.g. the most common defect in relation to any article, or the most common causes of the different defects)



## Quality Indexes
This module manages the definition of tables by Area / Topic / Summary Level, in which each record can be an event flag triggered by Q9000 or ERP data.


- Statistical Analysis of lots
-- Statistical analysis of Q9000 events by Lot, code, party
-- Supplier, customer and other parties rating using manual assessments, Q9000 events and audits with weight functions


# Support Modules
Modules for the definition of company standards and functional integration


- Document management system
-- Defines and manages documents identifiers
-- Defines and manages the distribution of a document during the approval process.

- Quality Procedure Manuals
-- Defines and manages quality procedure manuals
-- As in the document management system, defines and manages the distribution of a procedure manual during the approval process. The procedure manuals can be viewed when performing specific ERP functions.


- Ticketing management system
-- Supports issue tracking. Tickets can be categorized based on ticket types and statuses.

- Audit Management System
-- supports the definition of audits types and of the corresponding reference data, allowing the planning and the extraction of the elements being audited;
-- records evaluations and determines best and actual ratings
-- integrated with vendor rating solution

- HR skills and competencies management
-- Defines and Manages job positions and competencies within the company; supports the definition of the actual/required skill of the resources; supports the planning and management of training and development programs of the employees, including the cost determination of the program.

- Responsibility Matrix
-- supports the definition of classes of authorization to the processing of the various programs, forming the basis of the management of operational responsibilities.
